# Palindrome-Test
A puzzle that i've been working on from "A Byte of Python"

I can't seem to figure out how to make this work, the initial idea was to search the string of input for letters and then append those letters to a list.
Once the new list was filled it is supposed to run a reverse function to check against itself.
If it's a palindrome it says yes, if not then it says no.
